# Part 1: iPad prep

MDM stands for Mobile Device Management, it allows your institution to control your iPad. It also allows them to install restrictions.
The tool we are going to use cannot work with encrypted backups, as most MDM suites force backup encryption we will have to reset our iPad.

**ALL DATA WILL BE LOST.**

1: Plug in your iPad into your computer using a thunderbolt USB cable.

2: iTunes *should* automatically open. (If it doesn't open it from your start menu.)

3: A screen should pop up saying "Welcome to iPad" just click continue. You should now be on an information page. (If it doesn't open,
look on the far left on the devices screen and click on it.)

4: There should be a photo of your iPad. To the right of that, there should be two buttons - "CHECK FOR UPDATE" and "RESTORE". We want to select restore.

5: A popup asking you whether or not you want to restore will show up, select "Restore". Your computer will begin to download the latest version of iOS. You can check the progress of the download at the top right of the screen (near the minimize and close buttons.)

6: As soon as you have restored the default setup screen should show. With words such as "Hello" and "Hola" showing up. Keep your iPhone plugged into your computer and make sure you select (setup as new iPhone).

7: Do the usual setup process that involves setting up Wifi and entering student or employee username and password. After you have done this your iPad will finally say "Welcome to iPad."

8: *AS SOON AS YOU CLICK THIS YOU WILL SEE YOUR HOMESCREEN* **OPEN THE CONTROL CENTER (SWIPE UP) AND TURN ON AIT
